    <h2>How Flash Works</h2>
    <p>
        Since late 1990s, Flash has been a popular tool for creating animations,and later for playing audio and video 
        in websites. 
        <p>
        When you create a Flash file in the Flash authoring environment, it is saved with the
        <b>.fla </b>file extension. In order to use this file on a web page it has to be saved in different 
        format known as <b>SWF</b> <em>(it has the .swf file extension)</em>
       </p>
    </p>
    
    <hr><hr>
    The most popular way of creating Flash into a web page is by using javascript.

    <div id="bird"><p>An animation of a bird taking a shower.</p></div>
    <p>The script here is called SWFObject. Advantage to using it allows browsers to show
        to show alternative content for users whose browsers are capable of showing Flash.
    </p>
    
    <code>
        &ltscript type="text/javascript" src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/swfobject/2.2/swfobject.js"></script>
        <br>&ltscript type="text/javascript">swfobject.embedSWF("flash/bird.swf","bird","400","300","8.0.0");</script>
    </code>

    <p>
        <em>The type attribute is used on the script tag element to indicate that the script inside is written in JavaScript.
            The src attribue tells the browser where to find the sccript.
        </em>
    </p>
    <p>
        <em> The second script element is used to tell the browser about the Flash movie, as well as which
            element it should replace. This element is actually telling the SWFObject script <b>five</b> pieces
            of information.
        </em>
    </p>

    <h2>VIDEO FORMATS AND PLAYERS</h2>

    <h3>Formats</h3>

    <p>Some of the Video formats:</p>
    <uls>
        <li>BluRay</li>
        <li>DVD</li>
        <li>VHS</li>
        <li>AVI</li>
        <li>QuickTime</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    The process of converting a video into another format is sometimes referred to as "encoding" the video. <br>
    There are several applications on the web to enable encode videos such as 
    <em><a href="http://www.mirovideoconverter.com/" target="_blank">www.mirovideoconverter.com</a></em>
